# Sculpt-3D {#mainpage}

An open-source, cross platform, 3D sculpting application.

This is a Qt6-based desktop application with a Vulkan viewport, which uses the [Vulkan metal extension](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/man/html/VK_EXT_metal_objects.html) on macOS (not [MoltenVK](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/MoltenVK)).

Developers should read the [source code](#source-code) documentation for reference.
